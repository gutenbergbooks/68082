<p class="drop-cap"><i>THE war that started on August 1,
1914, has gradually involved nations,
large and small, not originally
participants. Other nations, large and
small, while still managing to maintain
an official neutrality, have found themselves
drawn into diplomatic controversies
with both groups of belligerents. With the
exception of South America, the continents
of the world have sent contingents to fight
in Europe. The destinies of Africa, Asia,
and Australia are at stake, and the destinies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
of the western hemisphere will, long before
the end is reached, be influenced vitally by
the tremendous events that are taking place
in Europe. We can, then, without exaggeration,
call the war that was provoked by
the Austro-Hungarian ultimatum to Servia,
a world war.</i></p>

<p><i>Still in the midst of war, still prejudiced
by our sympathies and our interests, neither
participants nor spectators are in a position
to form a definitive judgment upon the
many problems of the origin of the war, and
upon controversial points that have arisen
between the belligerents and between belligerents
and neutrals, because of acts of war.</i></p>

<p><i>But can we assume the attitude of suspending
judgment in regard to <span class="u">all</span> that has happened
since August, 1914, and <span class="u">all</span> that is
happening to-day? The world at heart is
not cold-blooded. The world at heart is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
hopelessly selfish. The world at heart is
not deaf to the appeal of the innocent and
helpless. Else we should have reason
indeed to believe in the complete disappearance
of our twentieth-century Christian
civilization. If some issues are debatable,
if some events are obscure, if some
charges and counter-charges cannot be
determined, there are others that can be
determined.</i></p>

<p><i>It is because the Armenian massacres
in Turkey are clearly established, because
responsibilities can be definitely fixed, and
because an appeal to humanity can be made
on behalf of the remnant of the Armenian
race in the Ottoman Empire without the
slightest suspicion of political interest, that
I feel it advisable <span class="u">and</span> <span class="u">imperative</span> at this
moment to call attention to what is undoubtedly
the blackest page in modern history, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
set forth the facts, and to point out the
responsibilities.</i></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">INTRODUCTORY</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">IN the summer of 1908, when the
Young Turks compelled Abdul Hamid
to re-establish the constitution
he had granted, and almost immediately
suppressed, at the beginning of
his reign thirty years before, they had
a good press throughout the civilized
world. Writers of all nations lauded the
Young Turks, and described in glowing
terms the wonderful future of the Ottoman
Empire under the régime of Liberty,
Equality, and Fraternity. The goodwill
of Europe and America, and practical
encouragement as well, was given to the
reformers of Turkey in every possible
way. Especially among the Powers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
Great Britain and France aided the
Young Turks to establish the new régime
by lending them money and capable advisers
for the Treasury and Navy, the
two departments of the Turkish Government
that were the weakest.</p>

<p>One has only to look through the
files of the newspapers of Occidental
Europe to establish the truth of this
statement. As one of the group of
writers for the European and American
press on Turkish affairs, during the first
difficult (and disappointing!) years of
the constitutional régime, I can say
honestly that our loyalty to the Young
Turks was unswerving. In the hope that
the end would justify the means, I am
afraid that there was not one of us who
did not occasionally sin against his own
convictions by <i>suppressio veri</i>, if not by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
actual <i>suggestio falsi</i>. Occidental diplomacy
was just as loyal to Young Turkey
as was Occidental journalism. Successive
Grand Viziers assured me that the loyal
co-operation of London and Paris, through
willingness to forbear criticism and to
leave much unsaid, had made possible
the maintenance of the newly-established
constitution throughout the first difficult
winter, and the weathering of the storm
of Abdul Hamid’s attempted counter-revolution.</p>

<p>It was my fortune to go to Turkey during
the first month of the new régime, and
to live in Asia Minor and Constantinople
until after the disastrous war with
the Balkan States. From 1908 to 1913,
I enjoyed exceptional opportunities of
travelling in European and Asiatic
Turkey, of becoming acquainted with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
men who were guiding the destinies of
the Ottoman Empire, and of witnessing
the fatal events that changed in five
years the hope of regeneration into the
despair of dissolution. At Smyrna, at
Constantinople, and at Beirut, I took
part in the fêtes to celebrate the birth
of the new régime, and saw the ostensible
reconciliation of Christian, Moslem, and
Jewish elements. Christian priests and
Moslem ulema embraced each other and
drove through the streets in triumphal
procession in the same carriages.</p>

<p>Above all, from the very beginning, I
was in a position to become intimately
acquainted with the Armenians of Turkey
and to find out their real sentiments
towards the Young Turks and the new
régime. I was in Adana, in April, 1909,
when their enthusiastic loyalty was rewarded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
by a massacre of thirty thousand
of them in Cilicia and northern
Syria. I was able to observe the attitude
of the Armenians before the massacre.
Their blood was spilled before my eyes
in Adana. I was with them in different
places after the fury of the massacre had
passed.</p>

<p>This preamble in the first person is
reluctantly written. But I feel that it
must be given, in order that I may anticipate
exception to my statements on the
ground that I am “not acquainted with
the problem,” and that “it is impossible
for an outsider to form a judgment on
these matters.” For I have always
found that the Turk <i>and his friends</i>, when
you speak to them on the Armenian
question, flatly deny your facts and
challenge the competency of your judgment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
It is necessary, then, for me to
state that the facts set forth here are given
with intimate personal knowledge of their
authenticity, and that the judgments
passed upon these facts are the result of
years of study and observation at close
range.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I</h2>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class="hangingindent">
<p><span class="smcap">In April, 1915, the Ottoman Government
Began to Put into Execution
throughout Turkey a Systematic
and Carefully-prepared Plan to
Exterminate the Armenian Race.
In Six Months Nearly a Million
Armenians have been Killed.
The Number of the Victims and
the Manner of their Destruction
are without Parallel in
Modern History.</span></p>
</div></div>


<p class="drop-cap">IN the autumn of 1914, the Turks began
to mobilize Christians as well as
Moslems for the army. For six
months, in every part of Turkey, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
called upon the Armenians for military
service. Exemption money was accepted
from those who could pay. A few weeks
later the exemption certificates were disregarded,
and their holders enrolled.
The younger classes of Armenians, who
did not live too far from Constantinople,
were placed, as in the Balkan wars, in the
active army. The older ones, and all the
Armenians enrolled in the more distant
regions, were utilized for road, railway,
and fortification building. Wherever
they were called, and to whatever task
they were put, the Armenians did their
duty, and worked for the defence of
Turkey. They proved themselves brave
soldiers and intelligent and industrious
labourers.</p>

<p>In April, 1915, orders were sent out
from Constantinople to the local authorities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
in Asia Minor to take whatever
measures were deemed best to paralyse
in advance an attempt at rebellion on the
part of the Armenians. The orders impressed
upon the local authorities that
the Armenians were an extreme danger
to the safety of the empire, and suggested
that national defence demanded
imperatively <i>anticipatory</i> severity in
order that the Armenians might be
rendered harmless.</p>

<p>In some places, the local authorities
replied that they had observed no suspicious
activity on the part of the Armenians
and reminded the Government that
the Armenians were harmless because they
possessed no arms and because the most
vigorous masculine element had already
been taken for the army. There are
some Turks who have a sense of pity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
and a sense of shame! But the majority
of the Turkish officials responded with
alacrity to the hint from Constantinople,
and those who did not were very soon
replaced.</p>

<p>A new era of Armenian massacres
began.</p>

<p>At first, in order that the task might be
accomplished with the least possible risk,
the virile masculine Armenian population
still left in the cities and villages was
summoned to assemble at a convenient
place, generally outside the town, and
gendarmes and police saw to it that the
summons was obeyed. None was overlooked.
When they had rounded up the
Armenian men, they butchered them.
This method of procedure was generally
feasible in small places. In larger cities,
it was not always possible to fulfil the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
orders from Constantinople so simply and
promptly. The Armenian notables were
assassinated in the streets or in their
homes. If it was an interior city, the
men were sent off under guard to “another
town.” In a few hours the guard would
return without their prisoners. If it
was a coast city, the Armenians were
taken away in boats outside the harbour
to “another port.” The boats
returned astonishingly soon without the
passengers.</p>

<p>Then, in order to prevent the possibility
of trouble from Armenians mobilized
for railway and road construction, they
were divided in companies of from three
hundred to five hundred and put to work
at intervals of several miles. Regiments
of the Turkish regular army were sent
“to put down the Armenian revolution,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
and came suddenly upon the little groups
of workers plying pickaxe, crowbar, and
shovel. The “rebels” were riddled with
bullets before they knew what was
happening. The few who managed to
flee were followed by mounted men, and
shot or sabred.</p>

<p>Telegrams began to pour in upon
Talaat bey at Constantinople, announcing
that here, there, and everywhere
Armenian uprisings had been put down,
and telegrams were returned, congratulating
the local officials upon the success
of their prompt measures. To neutral
newspaper men at Constantinople, to
neutral diplomats, who had heard vaguely
of a recurrence of Armenian massacres,
this telegraphic correspondence was shown
as proof that an imminent danger had
been averted. “We have not been cruel,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
but we admit having been severe,” declared
Talaat bey. “This is war time.”</p>

<p>Having thus rid themselves of the
active manhood of the Armenian race,
the Turkish Government still felt uneasy.
The old men and boys, the women and
children, were an element of danger
to the Ottoman Empire. The Armenians
must be rooted out of Turkey. But
how accomplish this in such a way that
the Turkish Ambassador at Washington
and the German newspapers might be
able to say, as they have said and are still
saying, “All those who have been killed
were of that rebellious element caught
red-handed or while otherwise committing
traitorous acts against the Turkish
Government, and <i>not women and children</i>,
as some of these <i>fabricated</i> reports would
have the Americans believe?” Talaat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
bey was ready with his plan. Deportation—a
regrettable measure, a military
necessity—but perfectly humane.</p>

<p>From May until October the Ottoman
Government pursued methodically a plan
of extermination far more hellish than the
worst possible massacre. Orders for deportation
of the entire Armenian population
to Mesopotamia were despatched
to every province of Asia Minor. These
orders were explicit and detailed. No
hamlet was too insignificant to be missed.
The news was given by town criers that
<i>every</i> Armenian was to be ready to leave
at a certain hour for an unknown destination.
There were no exceptions for
the aged, the ill, the women in pregnancy.
Only rich merchants and bankers and
good-looking women and girls were allowed
to escape by professing Islâm,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
and let it be said to their everlasting
honour that few availed themselves of
this means of escape. The time given
varied from two days to six hours. No
household goods, no animals, no extra
clothing could be taken along. Food
supply and bedding was limited to what
a person could carry. And they had to
go <i>on foot</i> under the burning sun through
parched valleys and over snow-covered
mountain passes, a journey of from three
to eight weeks.</p>

<p>When they passed through Christian
villages where the deportation order
had not yet been received, the travellers
were not allowed to receive food or
ministrations of any sort. The sick and
the aged and the wee children fell by the
roadside, and did not rise again. Women
in childbirth were urged along by bayonets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
and whips until the moment of deliverance
came, and were left to bleed
to death. The likely girls were seized
for harems, or raped day after day by the
guards until death came as a merciful
release. Those who could committed
suicide. Mothers went crazy, and threw
their children into the river to end their
sufferings. Hundreds of thousands of
women and children died of hunger, of
thirst, of exposure, of shame.</p>

<p>The pitiful caravans thinned out, first
daily, and later hourly. Death became
the one thing to be longed for: for
how can hope live, how can strength
remain, even to the fittest, in a journey
that has no end? And if they turned
to right or left from that road to hell,
they were shot or speared. Kurds and
mounted peasants hunted down those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
who succeeded in escaping the roadside
guards.</p>

<p>They are still putting down the Armenian
revolution out there in Asia Minor.
I had just written the above paragraph
when an English woman whom I have
known for many years came to my home.
She left Adana, in Cilicia, only a month
ago. Her story is the same as that of
a hundred others. I have the identical
facts, one eye-witness testimony corroborating
the other, from American, English,
German, and Swiss sources. This English
woman said to me, “The deportation is
still going on. From the interior along
the Bagdad Railway they are still being
sent through Adana on the journey of
death. As far as the railway exists, it is
being used to hurry the work of extermination
faster than the caravans from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
regions where there are no railways.
Oh! if they would only massacre them,
and be done with it, as in the
Hamidian days! I stood there at
the Adana railway station, and from
the carriages the women would hold
up their children, and cry for water.
They had got beyond a desire for
bread. Only water! There was a
pump. I went down on my knees to
beg the Turkish guard to let me give
them a drink. But the train moved on,
and the last I heard was the cry of those
lost souls. That was not once. It was
almost every day the same thing. Did
Lord Bryce say eight hundred thousand?
Well, it must be a million now.
Could you conceive of human beings
allowing wild animals to die a death
like that?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>But the Turkish Ambassador in Washington
declares that these stories are
“fabrications,” and that “no women and
children have been killed.”</p>

</div></div>


<p class="drop-cap">IN commenting upon the report of the
American Committee, on Armenian
Atrocities, Djelal Munif bey, the
Turkish Consul-General in New York,
declared: “However much to be deplored
may be these harrowing events in the
last analysis, we can but say the Armenians
have only themselves to blame.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
Djelal Munif bey went on to explain that
the Armenians had been planning a
revolution, and were killed by the Turkish
soldiers only after they had been caught
“red-handed with arms in their hands,
resisting lawful authority.”</p>

<p>This has been the invariable explanation
for the massacre of Armenians in
Turkey. We heard it in 1895-1896 and
in 1909. We have been hearing it again
in 1915. But facts to substantiate it
have never been given. On the other
hand, there exists overwhelming evidence
of the most convincing character
to show how inadmissible it is as an explanation,
how baseless it is as a charge.</p>

<p>I have talked personally with, or have
seen letters and reports from, American
missionaries and consular officials of all
nations, who were witnesses of the massacres<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
of 1895 and 1896. At that time, as
a result of unendurable persecution and
injustice, certain organizations of young
men, of the type the French call <i>exaltés</i>,
banded together in secret societies, an
imitation of internal organizations in
Russia, agitated, within the Ottoman
Empire and abroad, for a more favourable
treatment of Armenians and other
Christians. Some of these <i>exaltés</i> certainly
advocated, and tried to work for,
the independence of Armenia. But the
propaganda never gained favour in
ecclesiastical circles, nor ground among
the great mass of the Armenian population
in Turkey. Except in the <i>vilayet</i>
of Van, the Armenians no longer formed
the majority of the population. They
were too scattered throughout the empire
to have serious hope of winning independence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
such as the Greeks, Bulgarians,
Servians, and Rumanians had succeeded
in obtaining in the Balkan peninsula.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>In the 1909 massacre, I was on the
ground at the time, and studied these
charges. I demonstrated to my own
satisfaction (and to that of a number of
newspaper men, including Germans) the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
total lack of foundation of this charge
against the Armenians of Cilicia. Not one
Armenian out of a hundred had anything
to do with the revolutionary societies.
The lower classes were too ignorant to
be affected by such a propaganda. The
Armenian Church denounced the folly
of the visionaries. College professors
spoke and wrote against it. The wealthy
city classes frankly let the agitators know
that they were not only passively, but
also actively, opposed to the propaganda.</p>

<p>The Turks had nothing whatever to
fear from Armenian revolutionaries. They
knew this. More than that, they knew
just who the <i>exaltés</i> were. The Turkish
Government was well able to assure itself
that the propagandists were not to be
feared. If they had feared them, they
could easily have laid their hands on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
them any time they wanted to. In
Adana, the arrest of from thirty to forty
young men would have gathered into the
net all the agitators. Instead of that,
six thousand were massacred there, and
half the city burned. Then the Armenian
revolution was trumped up as an
excuse!</p>

<p>The hideous miscarriage of justice of
the court martial after the Adana massacre
was the beginning of the downfall
of the Young Turk régime. It was a
demonstration of the mockery of the
Young Turk assertion that the Ottoman
Empire was to be reconstructed on the
principles of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity.
From that day to this, their every
act has given the lie to their profession.
I say <i>hideous</i> miscarriage of justice, because
no element in the empire had welcomed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
more heartily the advent of the
constitutional régime, no element had
supported the Young Turks more loyally
than the Armenians. If they erred at all
during those first nine months of the
constitutional era, it was in showing so
openly—and so joyously—their touching
faith in the men of Salonika. They
accepted the revolution as sincere. Their
support of the new régime was spontaneous
and enthusiastic. They believed
in the Young Turks—until they were
undeceived by the Young Turks themselves.</p>

<p>After the massacre had stopped, <i>on
word from Constantinople</i>, I heard a Young
Turk officer address the survivors in the
courtyard of the American Mission at
Tarsus. He assured them that the danger
was over, that it had been due to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
counter-revolution of Abdul Hamid, and
that now they might feel assured that
Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity were
really theirs. He told the Armenians
that the Young Turks had suffered
equally with them, and that they had
been companions in misfortune. With
sublime faith, sublime even though stupid,
the bulk of the Armenians believed once
more. They accepted the explanation of
the massacre, and continued to support
the Ottoman Government.</p>

<p>During the four years after Adana, I
spent most of my time in Constantinople,
and I was constantly with the leaders of
the Armenian race. Never once did I
hear an Armenian ecclesiastic or other
Armenian of weight and reputation speak
against the Ottoman Government. I
know positively that they were not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
working against the Ottoman Government.
On the other hand, I am sure
that the Turks knew they could count on
the loyal support and co-operation of the
Armenians. The Turks had proof of
Armenian loyalty during the Italian war
and the two Balkan wars. Armenians,
enrolled in the Turkish army, fought
bravely for the common fatherland beside
their Moslem brethren. In the hour of
danger and humiliation, the Armenians
of Turkey stood by their fellow Ottoman
subjects. They gave their blood for
Turkey. Unlike the Ottoman Greeks,
they could be suspected of no secret
wishes for the success of the enemy.</p>

<p>It is unfair for the Ottoman Government
to cite, as basis for its charges against
its Armenian subjects, the fact that
Armenians in large numbers are fighting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
in the Russian army. As a result of the
war of 1877, Turkey was compelled to
cede a portion of Armenia to Russia.
The Armenians of these territories and
of the Caucasus have been for nearly
forty years under Russian rule, and
are naturally, as Russian subjects,
fighting against Turkey. In giving the
fact that there are Armenians in the
Russian armies as a reason for doubting
the loyalty of the Armenians in
Turkey, the Turks and their German
apologists have traded upon European
and American imperfect knowledge of the
history and geography of the regions
beyond Van. The formation of corps of
Armenian volunteers in the Allied armies,
and the open support of the cause of the
Allies on the part of Armenian communities
in France and Great Britain have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
been unfortunate. As individuals who
have left Turkey, these exiled Armenians
have a right to do as they choose, as
communities, it would have been—it is
now—better for them to keep quiet.
Although they have no justification for
doing so, the Turks and Germans have
been using the manifestations made by
these small communities outside of Turkey
as reflecting the spirit and intentions
of the Armenians in Turkey, and have
succeeded in confusing many neutrals
about the real facts of the Armenian
situation.</p>

<p>If the Armenians, during the present
massacres and forcible deportations, have
in some places, as they did in Adana in
1909, defended, arms in hand, their homes
and their loved ones, it has been only
when the Ottoman Government failed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
them, and when they were convinced that
their extermination had been decided
upon. Even in these cases, as at Adana,
when they received assurances of protection
against local Moslem fanaticism
from the Government at Constantinople,
they trusted once more. In every instance
of this kind—again let me remind
my readers that I have authentic
eye-witness testimony—their faith was
betrayed. The Ottoman Government
officials broke their word, and butchered
the Armenians after they had laid down
their arms.</p>

<p>With the possible exception of Van,
there was no place where the Turks had
the slightest ground for suspicion that
the local attempt of the Armenians to
defend their wives and children was in
connivance with the enemy. <i>And Van<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
is only one of thirty centres of massacre and
deportation in Asia Minor!</i></p>

<p>If the Ottoman Government has facts
to establish its contention that the Armenians
of Turkey were plotting against the
security of the empire, let it lay these
facts before the world.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class="hangingindent">
<p><span class="smcap">The Preservation of the Armenian
Element is Absolutely Indispensable
to the Well-being and
Prosperity of the Ottoman Empire.
It has been Proved through
Centuries that Christians and
Moslems are Able to Live in
Peace and Amity in Turkey, which
is Equally the Country of Both.</span></p>
</div></div>


<p class="drop-cap">ONE hesitates, on general principles,
to attempt to advise, or to admonish,
as to its best interests,
a nation at war. In a life and death
struggle such as this war has become,
it would be naturally supposed that a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
nation and its rulers are the best judges
of what it is to their interest to do.
Advice from outside sources is open to the
suspicion of being not disinterested. And
does not admonition, if not sheer impertinence,
betray impotence on the part of
the admonisher?</p>

<p>But in the Ottoman Empire, the situation
is different from that of any other
country in Europe. There is not a
sufficient number of educated men among
the non-Christian elements of the Ottoman
Empire to form, let alone to guide,
public opinion. Consequently, there is
no public opinion. The governing power
has always been in the hands of a small
and corrupt circle, and the Ottoman
nation has not developed in self-government,
in popular institutions, as have the
other nations of Europe.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>The new régime was hailed with joy
by the outside world, and by the non-Moslem
elements inside the empire as
well, because the Constitution of 1908 was
regarded as the starting point in a struggle
of the people of the empire, irrespective
of religion and race, against an absolutism
that had in practice proved equally injurious,
if not equally oppressive, to all the
races subjected to the tyranny of Yildiz
Kiosk.</p>

<p>It was very soon seen, however, that
Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity had no
part whatever in the Young Turk conception
of a constitutional state. It
was simply the replacing of one clique
by another. The honest, sincere Young
Turks, with motives above suspicion, who
actually meant what they said, were so
few in number that they could not prevail<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
against the type in the Committee of
Union and Progress, personified by such
men as Talaat, Enver, Djavid, Djemal,
Hairi, Ahmed Riza, Dr. Nazim, Hadji
Adil, Bedri, and Hussein Djahid. The
Moslem population of the empire, being
intensely ignorant, could not be looked
to by the few enthusiasts to support
constitutional principles. The Christian
population, much better educated and
having much more reason to appreciate
the newly-proclaimed liberty, were the
only elements upon which a politically
regenerated Turkey could stand. <i>For
this reason alone did the Armenian element
become immediately a source of danger to
the new clique that had replaced Abdul
Hamid.</i> These so-called Young Turks
turned upon the Armenians just as
Abdul Hamid had turned upon them—to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
prevent their becoming the leaven in the
regeneration of Turkey. The Constitution,
hailed by the Armenians as the
beginning of their political emancipation,
became almost immediately—and <i>inevitably</i>—their
death-warrant.</p>

<p>One does not need to study deeply, one
has simply to read the history of the
Ottoman Empire since Great Britain and
France saved the Turks by the Crimean
War, to realize that the Armenians, from
the moment the question of “reforms”
was introduced by the Powers in their
dealings with the Sublime Porte, have
been the unwitting victims of the
cause of civilization in the Near East.
The Congress of Berlin fully recognized
this fact.</p>

<p>The trans-Caucasian policy of Russia,
and the Balkan policy of all the Great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
Powers first awakened, and has since
been the exciting cause of, the fanaticism
of the Moslems of Turkey against the
Armenians. Before there was an acute
“Question of the Orient,” did we ever
have great Armenian massacres? And
yet, Christian Europe never made a concerted
effort to save this unhappy race
from the results of Europe’s own dealings
with the Turks.</p>

<p>The Armenians, of course, always suffered
to a certain extent from their social
and political disabilities under Moslem
rule. But they have lived for centuries
in comparative security, and certainly
with a large measure of prosperity, as
Ottoman subjects. Personal relations between
Turks and Armenians have been
not at all bad. I have had opportunity
to observe this fact in different parts of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
Turkey. The Turks are not, like the
Arabs, a fanatical people by nature. The
persecution and massacre of Armenians is
not, as the general European and American
public have erroneously thought, an
age-old matter of religious strife. Nor
has it been, as is so frequently asserted by
those who have the effrontery to explain
and attempt to condone (ye gods!)
Armenian massacres, because the Armenians
are money-lenders and oppress the
simple-minded Turks. The refutation of
the first of these two prevalent beliefs is
that the great Armenian massacres are
events of the last quarter of a century,
while Armenians and Turks have been
living together in Asia Minor nearly seven
centuries. The refutation of the second
is that the massacres have not been confined
to the larger cities, where many of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
the Armenians are well-to-do, but have
always taken place in exactly the same
way and in exactly the same degree in
communities where the Armenians are
both ignorant and poverty-stricken.</p>

<p>Nothing is more stupid, nothing more
against nature and history, than advocating
that the solution of the Armenian
question and salvation of the Armenian
race is in emigration <i>en masse</i> to America
or some other country. The Armenians
are an indigenous element in Asiatic
Turkey. Their wholesale emigration
might save the lives of several hundred
thousand individuals. But it would
break the hearts of most of those who
were thus saved, and it would mark the
disappearance of the Armenians as a
race and a nation, just as certainly as
if their extermination by massacre were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
completed. What has the Armenian race
done that it should disappear? And
is not <i>jus soli</i> as strong as the <i>jus patris</i>—especially
in lands where there is sunshine?</p>

<p>The preservation of the Armenian
element in Asia Minor is indispensable
to the well-being and prosperity of the
Turks themselves. Politically, as well as
economically, it is impossible for the
Turks to continue to exist as an independent,
and in any measure at all self-supporting,
nation without the help of the
Armenians. The Armenian massacres
illustrate the old story of killing the goose
that laid the golden egg. In their pitiful
ignorance, in their frenzy of blood-lust,
the Turks are turning upon and destroying
those whose existence is precious and
vital to their community and national<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
life. Travel where you will through
Turkey, from one end of the great empire
to the other, and you find no community
<i>that is prosperous</i> without Armenians.
Along the seacoast, the Greeks play an
important part in the economic life of
Turkey. But in the interior the Armenians
are a <i>sine qua non</i> to the Turks.</p>

<p>Of the Armenians in Turkey one might
have said without fear of contradiction
before the terrible events of the past six
months, that they were in no place
numerically strong enough to jeopardize
the political independence of the Ottoman
Empire, but that they were everywhere
in sufficient number to guarantee its
economic independence.</p>

<p>Intelligent and patriotic Turks must
certainly see that the attempt to exterminate
the Armenians, or to banish the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
remnant of them from Asia Minor, is a
mortal blow to Turkish independence,
political as well as economic. The extermination
of the Armenians is to the
interest of a certain nation—but that
nation is not Turkey!</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class="hangingindent">
<p><span class="smcap">The German Government could have
Prevented this Effort at Exterminating
the Armenian Race, but
has Chosen not to Do so. There is
Grave Reason to Believe the German
Government has Welcomed, if
not Encouraged, the Disappearance
of the Armenians from Asia
Minor, for the Furtherance of
German Political and Commercial
Designs on the Ottoman Empire.</span></p>
</div></div>


<p class="drop-cap">A PATRIOTIC German woman wrote
from Marash on June 4, 1915,
to the <i>Sonnenaufgang</i>, organ of
the <i>Deutscher Hülfsbund für christliches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
Liebeswerk im Orient</i>: “Oh, if we could
write all that we are seeing!” German
missionaries in Asia Minor have been
fully as horror-stricken, fully as sympathetic,
and fully as indignant as the
missionaries of other nations. And I have
no doubt that there are millions of Germans
to-day, who, <i>if they were allowed to
know the truth</i>, would protest bitterly to
their Government against the extermination
of the Armenian nation, and petition
their Government, in the name of
God, to do something to prevent Germany
from being stigmatized in history
as partner in the awful crimes that are
being committed in the Ottoman Empire.</p>

<p>It has been shown that there never has
been, and that there is not now, reason
for Moslem fanaticism against the Armenian
race. Of their own initiative, without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
the direct command and incitement
of the authorities and without the help
of the soldiery and gendarmery, Turks
have never massacred Armenians. Since,
then, this effort to exterminate the Armenian
race, made everywhere in Asiatic
Turkey at the same moment, has been
due to a systematic scheme, organized and
directed from Constantinople, we must
seek the responsibility among the officials
of the Turkish Government at Constantinople.
The deliberate, minutely-planned
Armenian massacres and deportations,
carried on without interruption from
April to November, 1915, must have been
conceived by someone, ordered by someone,
and perpetrated for some purpose.</p>

<p>Conceived by whom? Ordered by
whom? Perpetrated for what purpose?</p>

<p><i>The conception is not new.</i> It has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
explained above that the Armenians
drew upon themselves the distrust and
the hatred of the Young Turks because
they took the Young Turks seriously,
and believed that the Constitution was
to be a real constitution. The Adana
massacre was the first effort on the part
of those who usurped Abdul Hamid’s
policy and methods when they usurped
his authority, to destroy the Armenians.
Back in those days I heard more than one
prominent Young Turk give hearty assent
to the <i>bon mot</i> that was then going the
rounds, “The only way to get rid of
the Armenian question is to get rid of the
Armenians!” To finish the work begun
at Adana has been a political ideal for six
years. The opportunity for realization
came. It was seized immediately.</p>

<p><i>When the attack of the Allies against the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
Dardanelles was begun, it was common
knowledge at Constantinople that the death-warrant
of the Armenian race, long ago
signed and put aside in the pigeon-holes
of the Sublime Porte and the Seraskerat,
would be brought out and put into execution.</i>
Is it possible to believe that the German
Embassy was ignorant of this, and that
Talaat bey gave the orders without having
informed Baron von Wangenheim?
Is it possible that the German Government
at Berlin did not know of the plan,
even if their representative at Constantinople
failed to inform them? Here
are the facts.</p>

<p>The extermination of a million and a
half innocent, loyal to a fault, Christian
subjects of the Sultan of Turkey was
planned at, and ordered from, Constantinople.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>At Constantinople, the one man whose
word, supported by his Government,
would have prevented the orders from
going out, was the German Ambassador.</p>

<p>Although he <i>may</i> not have known during
the first week or two, the German
Ambassador was pled with, <i>long before it
was too late</i>, to use the influence of Germany
to put a stop to what was to prove
the blackest page of modern history.</p>

<p>Since Germany refused to intervene
before the extermination of the Armenians
started, is she not accessory before
the fact to the murder by sword, by
starvation and thirst, by exposure, by
beating, by rape, of nearly a million
human beings, whose fault was that they
were “in the way,” and whose vulnerability
and defencelessness lay in the sole
fact that they were Christians?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>Since Germany has persisted in refusing
to intervene during the process of extermination,
is she not <i>particeps criminis</i>?</p>

<p>Ambassador von Wangenheim declared
to Ambassador Morgenthau at Constantinople
that Germany could not, upon
request of the United States, intervene in
the internal affairs of Turkey. Ambassador
von Bernstorff at Washington,
when he saw what a painful impression
the newspaper accounts of the Armenian
atrocities were producing on the American
public, at first denied that there had
been massacres, and, later, when it was
impossible to maintain his denial in face
of established facts, declared that what
had happened in Turkey was a perfectly
justifiable suppression of Armenian rebellions.</p>

<p>In one large city of Asiatic Turkey, an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
American missionary, a man whom I
know personally and whose word can be
trusted implicitly, saw a German officer
directing the artillery fire of the Turks
upon the Armenian civilian population.
In two other places, at least,
German consuls defended the Ottoman
policy both of massacre and of deportation.</p>

<p>On the broader and more general moral
ground of responsibility as brother’s
keeper, the German, <i>who alone of all
European nations have had, and still have
the power to stop these massacres</i>, stand
condemned. It is going to be difficult
for their writers, who have been foremost
in extolling the Armenian race, its virtues,
and its contributions to civilization, to
defend to the satisfaction of posterity the
inertia of the German Government in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
face of the extermination of the Armenian
nation.</p>

<p>That they kept quiet, and refused to
act, when they alone could have saved
the Armenians from destruction, is the
first count in the case against the Germans.
It is serious. The second count is sinister.</p>

<p>When we try to find the purpose
behind the Armenian massacres, we are
confronted with what is, under the circumstances,
an eloquent accusation against
the German Government and the German
people. <i>The Germans, and the Germans
alone, will benefit by the extermination of
the Armenians.</i> I have pointed out above
how the Armenians are the essential
factor, the guarantee indeed, of Turkish
economic and political independence in
Asia Minor. By the same token, they
appear to be a stumbling-block to German<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
domination. The Armenians, largely educated
in French and American schools,
speak French and English. Through
their commercial relations with western
Europe and America, with England most
of all, they have naturally been “in the
way” of the German commercial travellers.
As the one commercial and agricultural
element in the interior of Asia
Minor, capable of holding its own against
a penetration of European colonists, the
Armenians are “in the way” of the
schemes for the Germanization of Anatolia.
It was not for the Bagdad Railway
alone, but also for all that the Bagdad
Railway implied, that Kaiser Wilhelm II.
fraternized with Abdul Hamid, after
the massacres of Armenians in 1895 and
1896.</p>

<p>I have not the slightest desire to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
unfair to Germans as individuals, or to
insinuate what cannot reasonably be
proved to be in the German mind.
Enlightened nations, however, are certainly
responsible for the acts of their
Governments. The Germans have assumed
the responsibility for many terrible
things in this war. They may hope,
when passions have died down and both
sides are known, to clear themselves of
some charges. But there is no hope in
regard to the charge of allowing the
extermination of the Armenians—a crime
by which they alone could hope to benefit.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CONCLUSION</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap2">AND now, in conclusion, let me
pose frankly this question: <i>Have
neutral nations any responsibility
in regard to the Armenians?</i></p>

<p>For neutral nations in general, the
answer depends upon whether the influence
and action of a nation ought to be
confined wholly to internal affairs. Those
who give to their own conscience and to
God the answer of Cain, say frankly: “No,
we are not our brother’s keeper. We
have all that we can do to look after
ourselves.” If this type of mentality
had controlled the councils of the nations
throughout the past twenty centuries,
would there be a Christian civilization?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
Would history be able to record a single
altruistic deed to a nation’s credit?
Would slavery ever have been abolished?
The other type is composed of those
who believe that man does not live by
bread alone, or for himself alone, and that
nations, as well as individuals, have responsibilities
towards others—especially
if those others are weak and oppressed.</p>

<p>Let us leave wholly to one side the
argument of higher morality, this abstract,
intangible argument, which, when urged,
causes many to shrug their shoulders and
smile. Let us come to the concrete
reason for the direct responsibility of two
nations to intervene on behalf of the
Armenians. Among neutral and passive
onlookers, who have been silent while the
darkest page of modern history is being
written, the Americans and Swiss should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
not forget that their money and their
representatives have been working for
two generations in Turkey to elevate
the Armenians. Together with French,
British, Germans, and Italians, the Americans
and Swiss have helped to reawaken
the national spirit of the Armenian
nation. They have infused new life into
the Armenian Church. They have made
researches into Armenian history and
have given to the world the results of those
researches. They have taught the Armenians
European languages, and have imparted
to a race that had become ignorant
and backward, because separated from
Europe, the spirit of Occidental civilization.
<i>Were they seeking out victims to
deck with garlands for the sacrifice? Were
they fatting the calf for the slaughter?</i> Do
not say no! For the practical result<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
of their efforts to elevate the Armenian
race is that long journey from home to the
Valley of the Euphrates—now become
the Valley of Death.</p>

<p>Let us think hard. And then, for
God’s sake, let us act!</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> I do not mean by this statement to deny that the educated
Armenians, just as every other people under the
yoke of another race, have not longed, in their most intimate
sentiments, for the day when national aspirations
would be realized. But, the Armenians are above all a
practical people, and they did not look for what they knew
was impossible of realization. In the correspondence
concerning Armenian people in the Chancelleries of the
Great Powers and in the archives of the Sublime Porte,
<i>the question has always been to obtain reforms that would
secure for the Armenians only those privileges and only that
measure of security and freedom, to which they had the right
as Ottoman subjects to aspire</i>. In 1913, the Powers, <i>among
whom was Germany</i>, proposed to the Turkish Government
a plan for reforms in Asia Minor, which was accepted and
decreed by Turkey, but which was not put into execution.
Up to the time of this terrible crime of the past few months,
the Armenians demanded, and were glad to have obtained
in Turkey, only those reforms that Turkey had agreed
herself to put into effect.</p>
